				In September 2016, the data team at <i>The Economist</i> reported that the 1.5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan would have a harder time staying in the country due to pushback from the government. <i>The Economist</i> reported that the Pakistani government was taking a number of measures to send Afghans back to their home country, including requiring visas for the refugees to stay after November, and discontinuing the validity of “proof of registration” cards. The visual above compares the numbers of registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan against those who have returned from Pakistan since 1979. It predicts an increase in both registered and undocumented Afghans returning from Pakistan at the end of 2016.

				This report, published by the Watson Institute of International Affairs at Brown University, offers an overview of the displaced Afghan population. The report estimates that the number of Afghans displaced worldwide is 3,700,000, with 1.2 internally displaced persons and 2.7 million Afghan refugees living abroad. The report notes that while the majority of Afghans flee to Pakistan and Iran, the political situations of these host countries can be dangerous. Those that are internally displaced or repatriated often live in settlements where the living conditions are unhealthy and potentially deadly.

				This recent report from the International Monetary Fund looks at the uptick in Afghan refugees returning to their home country from Pakistan, Iran, and Europe, and how it has affected the country’s economy. The IMF report says that an estimated 700,000 refugees returned to Afghanistan in 2016, with the highest number returning from Pakistan. The organization notes that this influx of returning refugees could put a strain on Afghanistan’s economy, affecting citizens’ access to health and education services, as well as basic needs such as food and housing. The IMF itself provides monetary support to the Afghan government, which goes toward humanitarian assistance for these refugees. The visual shows a prediction of more than 3 million refugees returning to Afghanistan in 2017.

				This article from <i>Le Monde,</i> published back in November 2015, reported that Iran was sending Afghan refugees to fight alongside the Syrian army, which supports President Bashar al-Assad. The article cited <i>The Guardian,</i> which reported that Afghan refugees had been fighting in Syria since 2011 as part of the Fatimiyoun Brigade, the second largest foreign-led army fighting for Al-Assad after Hezbollah. The visual does not relate directly to the Afghan refugees, but rather to where various alliances fall in the Syrian conflict.
