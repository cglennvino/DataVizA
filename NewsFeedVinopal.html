				<div>In September 2016, the data team at <i>The Economist</i> reported that the 1.5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan would have a harder time staying in the country due to pushback from the government. <i>The Economist</i> reported that the Pakistani government was taking a number of measures to send Afghans back to their home country, including requiring visas for the refugees to stay after November, and discontinuing the validity of “proof of registration” cards. The visual above compares the numbers of registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan against those who have returned from Pakistan since 1979. It predicts an increase in both registered and undocumented Afghans returning from Pakistan at the end of 2016.</div>

				<div>This report, published by the Watson Institute of International Affairs at Brown University, offers an overview of the displaced Afghan population. The report estimates that the number of Afghans displaced worldwide is 3,700,000, with 1.2 internally displaced persons and 2.7 million Afghan refugees living abroad. The report notes that while the majority of Afghans flee to Pakistan and Iran, the political situations of these host countries can be dangerous. Those that are internally displaced or repatriated often live in settlements where the living conditions are unhealthy and potentially deadly. </div>
